This project allows for Users to loan Books (up to a limit of 3) or subscribe to them to know when those Books are no longer on loan. When subscribing a User can filter by Genre, Author or select the Book specificaly 
by its Id (format BK1, BK2...). Realistically a Librarian class would handle Book loans and returns but this functionality has been paired with User for simplicity.
